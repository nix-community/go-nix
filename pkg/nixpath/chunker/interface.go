type Chunk []byte

// Chunker describes the interface that a given chunker needs to implement.
// Next() is periodically called until io.EOF is encountered.
// In case of no error, Next() returns a new chunk.

// TODO: is this interface the right one, or should we add initialization
// to the interface? Look at how it's used in pkg/store/import.go
